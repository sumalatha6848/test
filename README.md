For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Gradle 7.5](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=7.5&format=bin)

## Project Dependencies

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a CustomerRewardsSystem application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.rewards.customerRewardsSystem.CustomerRewardsSystemApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins.gradle) like so:

```shell
gradle clean
gradle bootRun
```
This will create:

* H2 in memory data base
* CustomerRewardsSystem application creates table(CUSTOMER_TRANSACTION) mentioned in schema.sql
* Insert the test data provided in data.sql while application bootstrap
* URL to acces the H2 console [H2-console](http://localhost:8080/Customer/h2-ui/)
* Provide JDBC URL 'jdbc:h2:mem:testdb' in h2 console and connect DB to verify the test data
